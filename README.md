# Codecademy's Mysterious Organism Project

## Introduction

This is a project presented as part of the javascript coursework on Codecademy at <https://www.codecademy.com/projects/practice/mysterious-organism>. The project uses objects, arrays, loops, and conditional statements to manipulate and compare the output of a factory function which creates the \"Mysterious Organism\"

## Technologies

Javascript

## Launch

main.js can be run within an IDE with results printing to the console, tests have been commented out towards the bottom of the file

## Table of contents

* Line 3: Function used to return a single random DNA base
* Line 9: Function used to return a DNA strand consisting of 15 DNA bases
* Line 22: Function used to return a random specimen number
* Line 26: Factory function to create mysterious organisms as needed
  * Within factory function:
    * Line 30: Method used to mutate a single DNA base within a given organisms DNA strand
    * Line 43: Method used to compare the DNA strands of another organism with this organism
    * Line 56: Method used to determine if this organism will likely survive
* Line 73: Function used to create an array of 30 organisms that are likely to survive
